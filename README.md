Developed an assembler that takes text instruction as input and outputs the bits that corresponds to the instruction, and a virtual machine that reads instruction from register, analyzes the opcode, performs the instruction and fetches the next instruction. Architected using object-oriented concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
